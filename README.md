# Website Landing Page
This project is centered around making a sample website landing page that's elegant (code-wise and UI-wise), responsive and contains the most basic elements you would find in any other landing page.

### Purpose
This can be helpful to anyone who's new to web development and is looking for a real life implementation of HTML/CSS that's also simple and easy to follow.

It's a small project, but should give a starting point as well as possibly design inspiration for your future work. You're expected to meet with the implementations of different components including:
- Navigation bar
- Carousel
- Focused Cards
- Subscription form
- Footer with links

The most interesting part however, would be learning about how these elements transform with Bootstrap as the screen size changes.

### Technologies
You would find that it's composed of mainly HTML and CSS. It was also created as a sample for using [Bootstrap]([url](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)) and heavily depends on it to achieve the compatibility with different screen sizes.
